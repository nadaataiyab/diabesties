6) Looking ahead

BACKGROUND
-My background has been in management and finance for healthcare and technology
companies.  I also have a passion for helping people improve their health
through behavior change and I ran my own health coaching business for a few years.

THE PROJECT
-My capstone project uses data from an app called Diabesties
-Diabesties was built to help college students with Type 1 Diabetes better manage
their blood sugar levels
-Type 1 diabetes, unlike type 2, is an autoimmune condition that usually begins
in childhood and destroys the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin
-Consequently, type 1 diabetics have to take insulin and monitor their blood sugar
levels multiple times a day to make sure their glucose levels don't get too high
or too low
-This requires a lot of discipline and diligence and so when children go to college
and no longer have parental oversight, they have a pretty tough time with this
-The College Diabetes Network partnered with a Canadian digital health app
developer called Ayogo to build Diabesties offer a solution.
-Diabesties solution is to give college students
a way to log their glucose, carbs, and insulin and share that information
with a 'diabestie' who is a friend that can offer support and keep them accountable.

-My objective was to use machine learning algorithms to try to predict
whether a user would continue to user the app or stop using the app, also
known as churn modeling.
-Even though the app is no longer running I thought this could help provide
some great insights into how to build a churn model for similar digital
health products and what types of data would provide the most predicitve power



1. Exploratory data analysis - understand whot he users were and how they used the app
2. Results of modeling and which variables were the most important
3. Conclusions and next steps


APP STATS AND DATA
-It was an iphone app that ran for three years from 2012 - 2015.
-It was built by a canadian company called ayogo that specializes in
apps to sustain patient engagement for the College Diabetes Network

-Over the course of three years it had
  -3085
  -Logged X times
  -And di.... clicks
  -I mainly used three sets of data from the app, demographics, entries, and usage_counts
  -3000 users, 55000 entries, 350,000 types of clicks



EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Challenges:
1) Learn more about the users, patterns in the entries, and clicks
2) How to define churn
3) How to summarize the data to create features



USERS
-Who was actually using the app? Did it reach the target?
    -Turns out the average age was....
    -The mode was..., but age was....
    -show a histogram of age here
    -Pie chart of type 1 vs type 2 diabetics
    -Pie chart of male vs female
    -App was mainly users from the US, but also had people from all around the world
    -Another surprising fact - out of 3000 users, only X invitations went out,
    but only 100 ended up having a diabestie


BEHAVIORS
  -out of 3000, x clicked, and y actually did at least one log
  -only x % did more than one
  -> show histogram here of # of logs
  -> show breakdown of carbs, glucose, insulin, mood, note, and diabestie mood
  -> show duration histogram


HOW TO DEFINE CHURN?
    -since this was a retrospective project there were many ways I could define churn
    -best way would be to look one to two weeks out
    -look at if you could predict who would be a long term vs short term user


FEATURE ENGINEERING
-lots of
-The next challenge was to build features that would summarize the data:
      -# of entries
      -# of times logged moods
      -etc...
-a lot of challenges around dates, etc...
-here are the features I used....

MODELS
-after all that build up, now it's time to see....were we able to predict









---------------
THE BIG PICTURE PROBLEM - CHURN IN DIGITAL HEALTH APPS
-Many people may download an app with some healthy habit program and initially
use it with great enthusiasm but then give up after a few weeks
-So I wanted to see if I could use machine learning algorithms to predict who
might keep using an app versus who would give up or churn
-Because if you know in advance who is in danger of churning then you can try
to intervene.
