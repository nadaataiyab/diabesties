# Diabesties
## Churn Prediction for a Digital Health App

Diabesties is a mobile health app designed to help college students with Type 1 diabetes better manage their condition by tracking their blood glucose, insulin, and carbs and sharing their data with a friend or 'diabestie'. This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict user churn, which is defined as users that log their data less than ten times after the first week of use. 

This work was completed as a capstone project for the Galvanize Data Science Immersive program in Phoenix, AZ. 

The full presentation of the analysis will be made available by October 16th, 2017.
